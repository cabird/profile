<strong>Background</strong>
<p>I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University Of California, Davis.  I got my bachelor's degree in CS from <a href="http://www.byu.edu">Brigham Young University</a> in 2003.  I've worked at Caldera, Lineo, Embedix, Motorola, and Freescale so I'm a bit of
a Linux geek and an Open Source proponent.  I've also dabbled in the OSS world myself in the <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/">PyQt</a>, <a href="http://kate.kde.org/">Kate</a>, and <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a> projects.</p>

<strong>Research</strong>
<p>I'm interested in software engineering and programming languages.
I'm lucky to be working with my (sometimes wacky, but always fun)
advisor <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/%7Edevanbu/">Prem Devanbu</a>,
mining and analyzing bug data, mailing list archives, and source code
repository history from OSS projects. We're hoping to use social
network analysis techniques to understand, among other things, how the
social network structure of developers of a software project is related
to the structure of the software itself (hoping to validate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Law">Conway's Law</a>).</p>

<strong>Publications</strong> 
<br> 
<p> Since I'm funded on a grant from the NSF, the
taxpayers of the United States are paying for the research I (and many others)
do.  As such, I think it is ridiculous that access to most of the papers
produced by this research is restricted and requires payment (try downloading
my paper from the ACM <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1137983.1138016">here</a> as an
example).  I therefore list them below.

	<p class="abstract">Studies have shown that social factors in development organizations have a
dramatic effect on software quality.  Separately,  program dependency
information has also been used successfully to predict which software components
are more fault prone. Interestingly, the influence of these two phenomena  have
only been studied separately.  Intuition and practical experience suggests,
however, that task assignment (i.e. who worked on which components and how
much) and dependency structure (which components have dependencies on others)
together interact to  influence the quality of the resulting software.  We
study the influence of  combined socio-technical software networks on
the fault-proneness of individual software components within a system.  The
network  properties of a software component in this  combined network are able
to predict if an entity is failure prone with greater accuracy than prior
methods which use dependency or contribution information in isolation.  We
evaluate our approach in different settings by using it on Windows Vista and
across six releases of the Eclipse development environment including using
models built from one release to predict failure prone components in the next
release.  We compare this to previous work.  In every case, our method performs
as well or better and is able to more accurately identify those software
components that have more post-release failures, with precision and recall
rates as high as 85%.</p>

	<p class="abstract">Software engineering researchers have long been interested in
where and why bugs occur in code, and in predicting where they might
turn up next. Historical bug-occurence data has been key to this
research.  Bug tracking systems, and code version histories, record
when, how and by whom bugs were fixed; from these sources,  datasets
that  relate file changes to bug fixes can be extracted. These
historical datasets   can be used to test hypotheses concerning
processes of bug introduction, and also to build statistical bug
prediction models.  Unfortunately, processes and humans are imperfect,
and only a fraction of bug fixes are actually labelled in source
code version histories, and thus become available for study in the
extracted datasets. The question naturally arises, are the bug fixes
recorded in these historical datasets a fair representation of the full
population of bug fixes?  In this paper, we investigate historical data
from several software projects, and find strong evidence of systematic
bias. We then investigate the potential effects of "unfair,
imbalanced" datasets on the performance of prediction techniques.  We
draw the lesson that bias is a critical problem that threatens  both
the effectiveness of processes that rely on biased datasets to build
prediction models and the generalizability of hypotheses tested on
biased data</p>

	<p class="abstract">We are now witnessing the rapid growth of  decentralized source code
management (DSCM) systems, in which every developer has her own repository. 
DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which
 work output can flow sideways (and privately)
 between collaborators, rather than always
up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. 
Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its
misinterpretation. 
We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. 
Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded
contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, 
giving rise to new questions such as ``How do contributions flow
between developers to the official project repository?''
However, there are pitfalls. 
Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories.
The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly,
potentially creating confusion.  
For example, a commit is immediately visible
to all developers in centralized SCMs, but not in DSCMs. 
Our goal is to help researchers interested in DSCMs avoid  these and other
perils when mining and analyzing git data.</p>

	<p class="abstract">Complex systems exhibit emergent patterns of behavior at different levels of
organization. Powerful network analysis methods, developed in physics and
social sciences, have been successfully used to tease out patterns that
relate to community structure and network dynamics.  In this paper, we mine
the complex network of collaboration relationships in computer science, and
adapt these network analysis methods to study collaboration and
interdisciplinary research at the individual, within-area and network-wide
levels.  <br><br>We start with a collaboration graph extracted from the DBLP bibliographic
database and use extrinsic data to define research areas within computer
science.  Using topological measures on the collaboration graph, we find
significant differences in the behavior of individuals among areas based on
their collaboration patterns. We use community structure analysis,
betweenness centralization, and longitudinal assortativity as metrics within
each area to determine how centralized, integrated, and cohesive they are.
Of special interest is how research areas change with time. We
longitudinally examine the area overlap and migration patterns of authors,
and empirically confirm some computer science folklore.<br><br>We also examine the degree to which the research areas and their key
conferences are interdisciplinary.  We find that data mining and software
engineering are very interdisciplinary while theory and cryptography are
not.  Specifically, it appears that SDM and ICSE attract authors who publish
in many areas while FOCS and STOC do not.  We also examine isolation both
within and between areas.  One interesting discovery is that cryptography is
highly isolated within the larger computer science community, but densely
interconnected within itself.</p>

	<p class="abstract">Commercial software project managers design
project organizational structure carefully, mindful of available skills,
division of labour, geographical boundaries, etc.  These organizational
	"cathedrals" are to be contrasted with the "bazaar-like" nature of
	Open Source Software (OSS) Projects, which  have no pre-designed
	organizational structure.  Any structure that exists is dynamic,
self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated.  Still, in  large,
complex, successful, OSS projects, we do expect that subcommunities will form
	spontaneously within the developer  teams.  Studying these
	subcommunities,  and  their behavior can shed light on how successful
	OSS projects  self-organize.  This phenomenon could well hold important
	lessons for how commercial software teams might be organized.  Building
	on known well-established techniques for detecting community structure
	in complex networks, we extract and study latent subcommunities from
	the email social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python,
PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT.  We then validate them with software
	development activity history.  Our results show that subcommunities do
	indeed spontaneously arise within these projects as the projects
	evolve.  These subcommunities  manifest most strongly in technical
	discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration
	behaviour.</p>
