Currently, few undergraduate institutions provide any empirical background
to computer science and software engineering students.  ISO 9000 and CMM levels
require that a process be not only recorded and measured, but also 
analyzed and use to improve.  Most students interested in computer science
will become developers of some sort, and software engineering is a capstone
course at many institutions.  Thus, this type of analysis is required to
be a good software engineer and will give students a leg up in the work force

In addition, the state of empirical evaluation at the graduate level in
computer science is still quite weak compared to other science
disciplines.  Students need to learn how to perform a case study,
what types of empirical methods or required in different contexts, etc.
This is independent of the area within computer science that is being
studied.  Whether a student is evaluating a tool or comparing a new technique to
a previous one, a strong empirical background is needed.
